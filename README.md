# Productivity GUI

This is a productivity tool GUI in the web browser. A REST Api is used to save data entered by the user. Currently, only registered users can use the system.

Check out the [demo](https://productivity.ethanbaker.dev?DEMO).

* Chores list (Click a square to 'cross off' the day for doing the specific chore, can do a half strike, add new chores) (DONE, add ability to delete chore using trash button)

* Daily info (Grateful for, goals, targets, what will make today great, schedule)

* Calendar scheduling (schedule same event multiple days using shift click, click on specific day to focus and add events, scroll or enter time, etc)

* 13 week goals? (DONE-ish)
